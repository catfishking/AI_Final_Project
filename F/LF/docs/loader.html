### Reference

loader is a requirejs plugin that loads content packages. the specification of F.LF content packages is defined in [package](package.html)

## Usage

```
requirejs(['LF/loader!anystring'],function(){...});
```

## mechanism

#### 1 flf-config
loader expects that a flf-config element exists in the html document. it is a `<pre>` tag with id `flf-config` containing a JSON data structure. example:
```
{
	"location":"path/to/LF", //resource location. will be used as base url
	"package":"LF2_19" //path to the package relative to the base url
}
```
the location can be 'local', i.e. relative to the html file. it can also be 'remote', where it can be an arbitrary location following a `http` protocol.

#### 2 load package
`manifest.js` under the package directory is loaded and checked against the schema:

```
{
	"data":"string/url-js",
	"resourcemap":"string/url-js!optional"
}
```

#### 2.1 load data
load the specified data list, typically named `data.js`.

##### data loading
in `data.js` every object that has a `file` property will have the file loaded, which the file must be a valid [javascript data file](package.html#data_file_format) with a `.js` extension. the file path is relative to the root of the package. When the file is loaded, the data itself will be appended to the original object. for example:
```
/*before*/
data.js:
{
	object:
	[
		{id:1, type:'character', file:'path/to/hero.js'},
		...
	]
}
/*after*/
returned data:
{
	object:
	[
		{id:1, type:'character', file:'path/to/hero.js', data:{/*content of hero.js appears here*/}},
		...
	]
}
```

##### lazy loading
if global.lazyload is defined, a function `load()` is inserted to `package.data` 
with the following use:
```
function load
(sets,  //sets of data files to load
ready)  //callback when all requested files are loaded
{
	//the function is async
}
```

every object defined by `data.js` will be passed to `global.lazyload`, and `global.lazyload` shall return `true` if it wants to __not__ load the data file at this moment. the `data` property of that object will then be marked `'lazy'` in this case. if `global.lazyload` returns falsy or `global.lazyload` is not defined, the data file will be loaded immediately, and the `data` property of that object will contain the structure defined by the js file `file`. other properties defined by `data.js` are copied as is.

later, if the data files are wanted, one should call for example
```
package.data.load({'object':[1,2],'background':[1]}, //wants to load object with id 1 and 2, and background with id 1
function ()
{
	//all data is ready now
});
```

##### F.LF lazy loading scheme
- character data files are not loaded during startup, and are only being loaded when a match starts, only if that characters are being selected. note, as defined by `global.lazyload`:
```
delay loading of all character prefixed files. consider,
{id: 1, type:'character', file:'data/deep.js'},
{id:203, type:'specialattack', file:'data/deep_ball.js'}
as `deep.js` is of type character, any files matching `deep_*` will also be lazy loaded
```
- background data files will only be loaded for a specific match

#### 2.2 load resourcemap
if defined, load the specified resourcemap, typically named `resourcemap.js`.

#### return
the loader plugin is __blocking__, and will only return when all data files are loaded. the returned structure is like:
```
package:
{
	data:
	{
		object: [
			{id:30, type:'character', data:{...}},
			...
		],
		background:[
			...
		],
		...
	}
	resourcemap:
	{
		...
	},
	location: '../../LFrelease/LF2_19/' //location of the package relative to the html file
}
```
